# Project - Least Squares, Random Sample Consensus based Outlier Rejection
This project implements the Least Squares Technique using Vertical and Perpendicular distances approach for Line Fitting
This project also implements Random Sample Consensus(RANSAC) technique to perform outlier rejection

## Dependencies
python 3.5 minimum
numpy

## Data
The project uses the pickled data data1_new, data2_new, data3_new 

## Execution
Execute below script for Least Squares implementation as follows

`python3 HW1_all_data.py`

Execute below script for RANSAC implementation as follows

`python3 HW1_all_RANSAC.py`

## Results
Results are shown in ENPM673_HW1_Report.pdf
